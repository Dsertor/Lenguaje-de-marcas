      <p>Sergio Rolando is a web developer born in Málaga in 1996. From a young age, Rolando had always been passionate about film and began writing movie reviews at an early age. After graduating from IES Campanillas de Málaga in 2022, he began working at various IT companies in Spain, expanding his knowledge and skills.
        <br><br>
        In 2023, Rolando began working for the company Accenture, where he became one of the most promising and sought-after workers of his time. His unique style and initiative led him to have a large number of followers.
        <br><br>
        In the film industry, Rolando is also known for his passionate defense of audiovisual works such as documentaries and anime. Although he recognizes that in the latter, he still feels plots focused on a child and limited audience, such as the Japanese population, and therefore has not yet shown all its potential.
        <br><br>
        After his time at Accenture, Rolando began developing a web application with the aim of satisfying his own need to find films that match his tastes. This is how FilmView was born, a new way of understanding film, where the opinions of users are prioritized over professional reviews.
